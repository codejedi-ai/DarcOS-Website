# DarcOS - Web-Based OS for Exploring DARCY128 ISA

A web-based operating system designed for exploring the novel DARCY128 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and HIPS128 processor architecture. Inspired by 32-bit MIPS instructions but evolving into a 128-bit processor, DarcOS serves as an educational platform for understanding theoretical 128-bit processor concepts.

## ðŸ“Š Processor Evolution Analysis

For a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical benefits of 128-bit processor architecture, see our detailed analysis:

- **[Processor Evolution Analysis](docs/processor-evolution-analysis.md)** - Complete technical analysis
- **[Web Analysis Page](https://uw-rizzlers.netlify.app/#/analysis)** - Interactive web version

This analysis covers:
- Historical context of 32-bit to 64-bit transition
- Theoretical benefits of 128-bit architecture
- Specific domain applications (AI/ML, Cryptography, Scientific Computing)
- Performance projections and quantitative analysis
- When 128-bit architecture would actually matter

## ðŸš€ DARCY128 Emulator

The actual implementation of the DARCY128 processor emulator:

- **[DARCY128-Emulator](https://github.com/codejedi-ai/DARCY128-Emulator)** - Core processor emulator implementation
- **[MIPS32-Assembler](https://github.com/codejedi-ai/MIPS32-Assembler)** - Foundation assembler for DARCY128 ISA

These repositories contain the actual code implementations that bring the theoretical DARCY128 architecture to life!
