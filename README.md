# DarcOS - Web-Based OS for Exploring DARCY128 ISA

A web-based operating system designed for exploring the novel DARCY128 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and HIPS128 processor architecture. Inspired by 32-bit MIPS instructions but evolving into a 128-bit processor, DarcOS serves as an educational platform for understanding theoretical 128-bit processor concepts.

## ðŸ“Š Processor Evolution Analysis

For a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical benefits of 128-bit processor architecture, see our detailed analysis:

- **[Processor Evolution Analysis](docs/processor-evolution-analysis.md)** - Complete technical analysis
- **[Web Analysis Page](https://uw-rizzlers.netlify.app/#/analysis)** - Interactive web version

This analysis covers:
- Historical context of 32-bit to 64-bit transition
- Theoretical benefits of 128-bit architecture
- Specific domain applications (AI/ML, Cryptography, Scientific Computing)
- Performance projections and quantitative analysis
- When 128-bit architecture would actually matter

## ðŸš€ DARCY128 Complete Toolchain

The complete implementation ecosystem for the DARCY128 processor:

- **[DARCY128-Emulator](https://github.com/codejedi-ai/DARCY128-Emulator)** - Core processor emulator with register state viewer
- **[CS241-wlp4-compile-pipeline](https://github.com/codejedi-ai/CS241-wlp4-compile-pipeline)** - WLP4 â†’ Assembly compiler

### Complete Development Pipeline:
```
WLP4 Source Code â†’ WLP4 Compiler â†’ Assembly â†’ Machine Code â†’ DARCY128 Emulator (with Register State UI)
```

These repositories contain the complete toolchain that brings the theoretical DARCY128 architecture to life, with live register state inspection for learning and debugging.
